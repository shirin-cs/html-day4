		<h1>Dream</h1>
		<p>
		Dreams are a window into the infinite world of our imagination and desires. They can be as delightful as the sweetest honey or taste the bitterest. Dreams are different, just as people are different, and everyone has dreams. Dreams are often a reflection of our thoughts and feelings in real life, but sometimes they seem completely imaginary and far-fetched.

		<h1>The Nightmare</h1>
		<p>

	Last night I had a nightmare that still sends a shiver down my spine whenever I think about it. In my dream, I found myself standing in a street where not a single light was on. A heavy silence filled the air, and the only sound I could hear was the echo of my own footsteps on the wet pavement. I had no idea where I was or how I got there, but I felt as if someone was walking right behind me.

	The cars parked along the street looked like bent, silent shadows, and a cold wind was blowing. Suddenly, I heard a sound—like fingernails scraping against glass—coming from behind me. I didn’t dare turn around. I hurried my steps, but the faster I walked, the closer that sound seemed to get. It was as if something invisible was chasing me.

	I turned into a dark alley, and in an instant everything went silent; even the wind disappeared. In complete darkness, I stretched my hands forward but couldn’t see a thing. For a moment, I felt someone breathing against the back of my neck. My heart was pounding. I tried to scream, but my voice was stuck in my throat. Just as I felt that cold, unknown presence getting closer, I woke up in terror.

	My breaths were shaky, and I still felt as though a shadow was standing behind me. It took a few seconds to realize it had only been a nightmare. Yet the truth is, that dream hasn’t left my mind; it feels as though a piece of its darkness is still hiding somewhere in the corner of my room.
